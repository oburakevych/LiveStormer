        <h2>Lit Motors</h2>
        <h3>We are creating the future of transportation, today.</h3>
        <h4>Our vehicle</h4>
        <p>
            Currently code-named “C-1”, our vehicle is the future of transportation.
            Fully-enclosed and self-balancing, it provides car-like safety with an intuitive, car-like interface.
            The rear area is large enough to accommodate a passenger, or about as much cargo as you can carry on a plane.
            The C-1 is considered a motorcycle, allowing the driver to split lanes and easily slip through traffic,
            cutting up to 50% off commute times. And once at their destination, the driver can park in the tiniest spaces—even motorcycle-specific parking.
        </p><p>
            The C-1 is 100% electric, with a top speed of 100+ mph and a range of up to 200 miles per charge.
            Charge times depend on voltage, from six hours on 110/120V to four hours on 220/240V to less than a half hour (to 80%) at a 400-500V quick charge station.
        </p>
        <h3>Partnership Ideas</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h4>International Markets</h4>
                <p>
                    An expert in local regulations and logistics can secure exclusive distribution rights for the given country or region.
                    We will provide technical support, warranty, and are more than happy to modify or extended safety features to meet the regional requirements.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Industrial Applications</h4>
                <p>
                   While we are currently focusing on consumer use cases, we are open to other innovative applications.
                   An industry insider will easily see huge potential of C-1 in various industries, such as military, mining, and so on.
                   Sky is the limit!
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><h4>Autonomous Agents</h4>
                <p>
                    Since C-1 is equipped with our unique (and patented) self-balancing system, it is extremely easy to operate.
                    So easy, that even a computer can do it. With a couple of minor modifications it can be converted into an autonomous
                    delivery courier, a bot operating in an unfriendly environment, or just a friendly droid at your local golf club.
                    <br/>
                    We need your ideas and will be happy to provide your team of rockstar developers with all the APIs and schematics
                    to hack C-1 for your killer application.
                </p>
